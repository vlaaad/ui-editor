libgdx ui editor and library for importing ui layouts

### For now it works (poorly). 

Documentation coming not very soon. You can mail me if you want to contribute or have any questions.

There are some issues described in `todo.txt`. 

To run app:

    ./gradlew desktop:run
    
To compile library to load layouts in your app:

    ./gradlew runtime:dist
